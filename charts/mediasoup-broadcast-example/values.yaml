service:

    # external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname: media.example.com
  type: ClusterIP

  # A different port than 80, which can cause conflicts when hostNetworkIP is set.
  containerPort: 5398

  # When Kubernetes supports port -1 to mean all ports for
  # ClusterIP or LoadBalancer, you can use the following without hostNetworkIP:
  # rtpPort: -1

  # hostNetworkIP: 1.2.3.4 # example IP address
  #
  # You will need to label the node to which 1.2.3.4 is routed with:
  #   kubectl label node <MY-PUBLIC-NODE> hostNetworkIP=1.2.3.4
  #
  # Then the pod will use "hostNetwork: true", and it will be scheduled
  # only on the node returned by:
  #   kubectl get node -lhostNetworkIP=1.2.3.4
  #
  # This also sets the environment variable RTC_ANNOUNCED_IPV4=1.2.3.4

  # We usually recommend not to specify default resources and to leave this as a conscious

  #  cpu: 100m
